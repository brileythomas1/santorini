# Santorini

## Overview
This is a two-person project made in collaboration with Owen Zhang (ozhang8220 on GitHub). Made primarily in Python, our Santorini program allows you to simulate the board game by selecting various player types (a human player, an AI, and a random player) and allowing you to undo and redo moves. This program was made primarily to demonstrate object-oriented design principles, most notably design patterns. We utilized Command, Memento, Observer, and Strategy design patterns to help organize and modularize code using best practices. More details on how we used these patterns can be found in "patterns.txt". Also notable is our UML diagram showing the relationships between all of our different classes, shown in the pdf file provided.
